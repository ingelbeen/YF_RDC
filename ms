ABSTRACT
Between December 2015 and July 2016 a yellow fever (YF) outbreak affected urban areas of Angola and DRC, with 884 laboratory-confirmed cases (121 deaths) in Angola and 81 laboratory-confirmed cases (16 deaths) in DRC. Due to increasing presence of its mosquito vector (Aedes ssp.), outbreaks will probably reoccur in cities. Our study objective was to describe the outbreak and thus facilitate early recognition and diagnosis of future cases.
We retrospectively analyzed characteristics and outcomes of 78 confirmed YF cases in DRC using case investigation and hospital admission forms. Suspect cases presenting with jaundice within 2 weeks after acute fever onset were tested for YF by IgM serology or PCR for viral RNA.
Seventy-three percent of confirmed cases (57/78) had travelled from Angola: 88% (50/57) men; median age 31.0 years (IQR 25.0 – 36.5). Nineteen percent (15/78) were infected locally in urban settings in Kinshasa (n=8), Kwango (n=4), and Kongo-Central (n=3) provinces. We identified one geographical cluster of three cases in the same Kinshasa neighborhood. All other cases were widespread. Median time from symptom onset to healthcare consultation was 6.5 days (IQR 5-9), to appearance of jaundice 8 days (IQR 7-11), to sample collection 9 days (IQR 7-14), and to hospitalization 16.5 days (IQR 10.5-25.5). 
As jaundice appears late, most cases were only diagnosed and confirmed after two weeks, often too late for supportive care and prompt vector control. Local vector control was complicated because cases were not restricted to discrete neighborhoods. In areas with known local YF transmission, a wider suspect case definition without jaundice as essential criterion and improving access to primary care could facilitate earlier YF diagnosis, care and control. 

INTRODUCTION
Yellow fever can spread in urban areas where it is transmitted from human to human by Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus mosquitoes1. Infection is characterized by an initial non-specific phase which lasts for 3 to 6 days with fever, headaches, myalgia, and other flu-like symptoms. In 15 to 25% of cases a toxic phase follows with mild or outspoken jaundice, liver and kidney failure, which may lead to shock, bleeding and death 2,3. About half of the severe cases could die within 7 to 10 days3,4. The mosquito vector gets infected from a blood meal when viremia occurs, during the initial flu like phase, up to 6 days after symptom onset5. There is no specific treatment. Outbreak control relies on prevention through vector control and vaccination against yellow fever.
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) each year a large number of yellow fever infections occur following sylvatic transmission6. Because of limited mobility of cases suffering yellow fever infection in forest areas and probably also because vectors present in forest areas are less anthropophilic, these small outbreaks hardly ever spread to urban environments where Aedes aegypti and albopictus mosquitoes prevail. 
In December 2015 a yellow fever outbreak started in the Angolan capital Luanda. The outbreak in Angola intensified in March 2016, resulting in cases spreading to bordering provinces of DRC and its capital Kinshasa. The outbreak ended by mid-July 2016 when 884 cases had been laboratory confirmed including 121 deaths in Angola and 81 laboratory-confirmed cases including 16 deaths in DRC7. 
In a large urban population such as the 12 million people in Kinshasa other conditions also induce jaundice and fever, making diagnosis of yellow fever on clinical grounds alone extremely difficult. Our study objective was to describe the outbreak in DRC, clinical presentation of cases, and the difficulties encountered when diagnosing cases and reinforcing surveillance. 

METHODS
DESIGN + POPULATION (TPP)
We conducted an outbreak investigation in DRC between May and August 2016.

CASE DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES
The yellow fever suspect case definition used in routine surveillance in DRC was also applied during the outbreak: any person presenting an acute onset of fever followed by jaundice within 14 days after first symptoms onset. Any suspect case was tested for recent yellow fever infection through detection of yellow fever IgM antibodies or RNA at the Institut National de Recherche Biologique (INRB). IgM detection relied on two steps: an initial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine IgM flavivirus antibodies, followed by a series of consecutive specific ELISA tests exclude other flavivirus infections such as zika, dengue, chikungunya and West Nile fever. Presence of viral RNA, indicating viremia during the initial days of the infection, was detected using a RT-PCR assay. 
A yellow fever confirmed case was a suspect case who has not been vaccinated before symptom onset and for who yellow fever IgM antibodies or viral RNA were detected in the serum sample, or a suspect case that has been vaccinated but started clinical symptoms prior to vaccination. Confirmed cases are classified as locally infected or imported on the basis of a travel history in a country (no other province or zone of health) epidemic within 2 weeks before the onset of yellow fever signs. An imported case is a patient who stayed in Angola at the time of infection, i.e. 3 to 6 days (the incubation time for infection 8) prior to symptom onset. A locally infected case is a patient who was infected in the DRC, and who stayed in the DRC 3 to 6 days before the onset of the first signs. Locally infected cases can be either sylvatic, or linked to the large urban yellow fever outbreak. 
In addition to yellow fever diagnostic testing, for patients admitted to the yellow fever ward also a malaria rapid diagnostic test (SD BIOLINE Malaria Ag P.f, Standard Diagnostics Inc.) was performed.

PATIENT FLOW
When any patient presents symptoms indicating suspected yellow fever infection at a health care facility, the facility contacts the health district, who sends a nurse to assess whether the case responds to the suspect case definition, to collect a blood sample and to notify the suspect case. When autochthonous yellow fever transmission is confirmed in a health district in Kinshasa, community workers are trained on recognizing signs of yellow fever and encourage patients presenting these signs to consult a health care facility. In Kinshasa mobile teams operated by Médecins sans Frontières assess the need for hospitalization of any yellow fever confirmed case, or notified suspect case when no confirmatory test is available within two days. A standardized format is used to record the onset of symptoms, the symptoms a patient is presenting, presence of other infections such as malaria which may present similar symptoms, possible places where the patient may have been exposed including travel history, places visited during the first 6 days after the onset of symptoms when the patient is viraemic, using GPS to map all suspect and confirmed cases. Any confirmed or suspect case that requires hospitalization is admitted to a yellow fever ward where all cases of Kinshasa receive appropriate supportive care. Others are encouraged to remain under an impregnated bed net, to avoid spread of the virus when a viraemic yellow fever case is bitten by an Aedes mosquito in his surroundings.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Routine data from case investigations forms, notification forms, patient medical files and laboratory results were combined to carry out a retrospective cohort analysis. Case investigation forms and patient medical files recording symptoms and dates of onset, clinical evolution, comorbidities, demographic and epidemiological data and outcomes at discharge are filled in by trained clinicians. Notification forms with demographic data were filled in by health district nurses at the time a blood sample is collected. Laboratory results were shared on a daily basis by the INRB national virology reference lab.
Clinical and demographic characteristics and recorded outcomes are reported as frequencies or medians with range and interquartile range. Differences in dichotomous variables between cases and non-cases are analyzed using Pearson’s Chi-squared test. Mann-Whitney U test was used for differences in age and in delay of admission. All analyses were performed using R.

ETHICS
Only routine data were collected, anonymized, and analyzed. The study protocol was accepted by the Ethical Review Committee at the University of Kinshasa.

RESULTS
THE DRC YELLOW FEVER OUTBREAK
Yellow fever cases linked to the Angolan outrbeak were reported in two provinces neighbouring the Angolan border, Kongo-Central and Kwango, and in Kinshasa. 
By august 11 2016, a total of 2269 suspect cases were reported in DRC of whom 2025 (89%) underwent confirmatory testing. 81 cases were confirmed. 57 confirmed cases (70%) had travelled from Angola: 88% (50/57) men; median age 31.0 years (IQR 25.0 – 36.5). At least 15 cases (19%) were infected locally in urban settings in the Angola-bordering Kwango (n=4), and Kongo-Central (n=3) provinces and in Kinshasa (n=8): 67% men and median age 20.0 years (IQR 12.0 - 29.0). For three cases no travel history could be retrieved. 
We identified one geographical cluster of three locally infected cases in the same Kinshasa neighborhood, where another 3 deaths of suspect cases were reported, linked to a migrant worker who had returned from Angola with a fever. All other cases were widespread, and could not be linked to one another. 
We recorded 16 deaths among confirmed cases, resulting in a case fatality rate of 21%.
DELAYED DIAGNOSIS
The median time from symptom onset to a first healthcare consultation in any health care facility was 6.5 days (IQR 5-9), to appearance of jaundice 8 days (IQR 7-11), to sample collection 9 days (IQR 7-14), and to hospitalization a median 16.5 days (IQR 10.5-25.5). The delay to sample collection was not different among imported and locally infected cases.
74 confirmed cases were tested for the presence of yellow fever virus using RT-PCR. Among 9 cases (12%) viral RNA was detected. All were imported cases. 
Blood samples of all nine PCR positive cases were collected on a median 9 days after onset of symptoms, as shown in Table 1. Among PCR negative confirmed cases the delay was a median 10 days. This delay was not different between imported and locally infected confirmed cases, and was shorter among the suspect cases who tested negative (median 7 days).
Of one case viral RNA (RT-PCR) was detected but no IgM antibodies were detected. This case was hospitalized during two weeks in Angola for a suspected yellow fever infection. He received several blood transfusions during his stay in a yellow fever management site. One week after he was discharged he travelled to DRC, fell ill, and the blood sample was collected.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Fever and jaundice were the present in 13 (92.9%) and 10 (71.4%) of 14 confirmed cases for whom we recorded symptoms. Of signs not included in the suspect case definition myalgia, vomiting and headaches were most frequent, present in 88.9, 77.8 and 66.7% of cases respectively (Table 2). Hemorrhagic signs were only recorded in one case and we identified no cases with severe anemia when admitted. In 33.3% (3/9) of tested cases P. falciparum HRP-2 antigens were detected, indicating a current or recent malaria (co-)infection. None of them (0/3) showed rapid clinical improvement after starting treatment.
In suspect cases for whom yellow fever infection was excluded, we found that both fever and jaundice were present in 93 (96%) of 97 patients for whom symptoms were recorded, therefore limiting the positive predictive value of these signs for yellow fever infection to 3.9 and 3.0%. The combination of both, as in the suspect case definition, yields a positive predictive value of 3.2%. 81.1% (73/90) of suspect cases for whom a yellow fever was excluded tested positive for P. falciparum HRP-2. Of 13 malaria infected yellow fever negative suspect cases for whom follow up was recorded, two (15.4%) did not improve after starting malaria treatment.
The signs most predictive for infection were decreased diuresis (positive likelikood ratio or LHR+ of 4.57), myalgia (LHR+ 2.88) and bleeding signs (LHR+ of 2.80). Suspects with malaria infection were least likely to be cases (LHR+ 0.41). A combination of the current case definition and a negative malaria test yields an Area under the curve (AUC) of .739, and increased specificity to 81.1%. The applied case definition and combinations with any of the predictive signs did not yield a higher AUC. The case definition applied during the initial months of the 2010/11 yellow fever outbreak in Ugandan improved specificity (78.3%) but has low sensitivity (37.5%) on the cohort of our study, yielding an AUC of .579. The case definition applied during a second phase of the same outbreak yielded somewhat better sensitivity (55.6%), specificity (81.6%) and an AUC of .545.

DISCUSSION
The yellow fever outbreak in DRC was mainly an imported outbreak from Angola, and started to wane as vaccination went on in Angola. The majority of confirmed cases were young Congolese men working in Angola, who returned to DRC more than a week after symptom onset to seek health care. Although evidence of 15 locally transmitted cases in three different provinces, this did not provoke widespread urban spread of yellow fever as observed in Angola. Possible reasons for this may be 1) the timing of the initial local transmission at the start of the dry season, not allowing the vector carrying the virus to replicate, 2) the vector control efforts targeted around homes of confirmed cases and/or 3) the mass yellow fever vaccination campaigns before the end of the dry season in the affected districts.
Our analysis proves that when the suspect case definition for routine surveillance is used during an outbreak, the 10 first days of disease, critical for effective supportive care and targeted vector control, have already passed by the time cases are notified (at 9 days) and subsequently hospitalized (at 16 days)3,4. None of the locally infected cases have been tested when viral RNA was still present in the blood, confirming that cases were not notified during the initial days of infection. Only when jaundice appears 9 days after symptom onset the current case definition is met. 
In districts where local transmission of yellow fever is established an adapted case definition with or without jaundice would allow more rapid detection of cases. We would propose presence of (fever or jaundice) and a malaria negative RDT, or (fever or jaundice) and a malaria positive RDT without improvement following treatment. This would have, which would reach a  could be alternatives. if barriers such as access to healthcare facilities could be overcome too
The limitation of our study is that the data is limited to patients meeting the suspect case definition. We do not know the frequency of each sign in the urban (source) population. Therefore we cannot measure the sensitivity of any case definition that would allow more rapid detection of cases. Also, the number of confirmed cases with recorded clinical signs is too limited to measure certain signs of interest, such as the predictive value of living in a district with established local yellow fever transmission, or what proportion of yellow fever and malaria co-infected patients would not improve after starting malaria treatment.
74 confirmed cases were tested for the presence of yellow fever virus using RT-PCR. Among 9 cases (12%) viral RNA was detected. All were imported cases. 

The suspect case definition which was applied, i.e. fever followed by jaundice, was only present in 71% of the confirmed cases. More important even, From our findings we would propose in future outbreaks a wider suspect case definition, regardless of jaundice, in areas with local transmission, on top of the current case definition for areas where no local transmission is established yet. Fever and (jaundice or malaria RDT negative or (malaria RDT positive and no effect of treatment) would yield a sensitivity of 100% of currently detected cases and a specificity of ____. Its positive predictive value would increase to____. Moreover, if rapid access to healthcare can be guaranteed, case detection (and therefore appropriate yellow fever care and vector control) could be improved with more than a week. 
Our data of locally infected cases were too limited to establish a predictive value of demographic characteristics,  such as whether a case lived in an area with established local transmission, could improve the specificity of a case definition.

CONCLUSION
Because jaundice appears only more than a week after symptoms onset, most cases are only diagnosed and confirmed after two weeks, often too late for supportive care and prompt vector control.  In areas with local transmission of yellow fever virus, a wide suspect case definition without jaundice as essential criterion, could allow more rapid yellow fever diagnosis, care and control.
